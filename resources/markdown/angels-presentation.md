## What is Software Engineering?

Software engineers build the apps, games, and websites you use every day!

We write special instructions called "code" that tell computers what to do.

## How Roblox Works

Roblox is made with millions of lines of code!

- Players create their own games using "Lua" code
- Engineers built tools to let kids make their own worlds
- Software handles millions of players at the same time
